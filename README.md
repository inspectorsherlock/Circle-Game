# Circle-Game
I learnt from a Medium Tutorial how to create a game through PixiJS and implement collision detection between Circular shapes.
The game is a simple parallel to snakes except instead of the circle getting larger the circle speed increases ith each coin it digests.
Attained the understanding of class constructors, basic 2D physics and game logic implementation through code.
